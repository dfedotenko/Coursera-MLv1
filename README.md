These are exercises from Coursera from Andrew Ng's Coursera ML course v1, 
which has been retired in favour of a new one and is closed for enrollment: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course.
This original course is Octave/MATLAB-based and the exercises' files here capture the programming assignments in the course.
The exercises cover cost/gradient descent/hypothesis/normalization functions' implementations in MATLAB using non-vectorized and vectorized implementations.

This has been my first forray into MATLAB and ML in general. As such I might have vectorized some aspects less efficiently.
However, it was a lot of fun implementing linear, logistic, NN backprop, SVM, PCA, Gaussian anomaly and Collaborative filtering cost/gradients by hand!
